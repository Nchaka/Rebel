# Rebel

## A Node.js form (or PHP if you like)

### For Node:

1. Download the project
2. Delete the package-lock.json
3. Install Grunt globally `npm install grunt -g`
4. Run `npm install`
5. Do `grunt build`
6. Also `grunt serve`

Note: As you edit the files, the build will automatically re-build. You simply need to refresh very much like PHP. No live re-load on this.

### For PHP:

1. Download the project
2. Put it in your htdocs folder
3. Run your server
